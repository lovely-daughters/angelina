This is a custom jupyter kernel tailored for vanilla-js web development (chrome extensions are my specific usecase)

Jupyter notebooks are a huge timesaver that allow me to iteratively build up solutions.

I would like to extend this idea to the browser where I can remotely hook up a notebook to chrome and work through that in vscode.

I've tried reading js files as a string and passing that through selenium to chrome, but I have to develop in a separate file & variables aren't saved.

I've tried the ijavascript kernel paired with chrome-remote-interface, however that experience was extremely janky.
